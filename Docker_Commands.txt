#to see a list of all images on your system.

#The docker ps command shows you all containers that are currently running.
docker ps

#list of all containers that we ran.
docker ps -a

#run busybox bash
docker run -it  busybox sh  --- output:
bash-command:/ # ls -l

Danger Zone: If you're feeling particularly adventurous you can try rm -rf bin in the container. 
Make sure you run this command in the container and not in your laptop/desktop. 
Doing this will not make any other commands like ls, echo work. 
Once everything stops working, you can exit the container (type exit and press Enter) 
and then start it up again with the docker run -it busybox sh command. 
Since Docker creates a new container every time, everything should start working again.

#Dopo usati i contenitori bisogna eliminarli:
docker ps -a (per elencarli)

#per eliminarli uno a uno:
docker rm b654588613df e744045b1a00 e744045b1a00

#per eliminarli tutti insieme:
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q -f status=exited)

#ultima versioni di coker:
docker container prune
